To run the notebook successfully, you will need a Python 3 environment (such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab) and a CUDA-capable GPU (the notebook metadata specifies an NVIDIA T4 GPU). The following third-party packages must be installed:
numpy
cupy (requires a CUDA-compatible version depending on your system, e.g., cupy-cuda12x)
matplotlib
(Note: The standard library module time is also used for performance benchmarking but does not require manual installation.)

Installation Command:
pip install numpy matplotlib cupy-cuda12x jupyter
