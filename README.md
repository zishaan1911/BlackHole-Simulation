# BlackHole-Simulation
The GPU-Accelerated Kerr Ray Tracing system is a simulation tool designed to visualize a rotating black hole's shadow and its accretion disk. By performing ray tracing within the Kerr metric, the notebook traces photon geodesics backward from the observer's camera to determine where light originates.
